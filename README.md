# Google APIs Conformance Tests

This repository is used to host a collection of conformance tests
for Google API client libraries. Conformance tests are mainly used by
Google APIs Github Organization repositories for language client libraries.

## Conformance Test Specification

Conformance tests in these repos generally share these characteristics:

- Tests are specified as a set of inputs and expected outputs, and are defined
in .json files (ex [here](https://github.com/googleapis/conformance-tests/blob/master/storage/v1/v4_signatures.json)).
- Test .json files are paired with a .proto (ex [here](https://github.com/googleapis/conformance-tests/blob/master/storage/v1/test.proto))
that defines the specification for the .json file. The .json files are verified
to match the .proto by a simple validator program that's run in CI.

The shape of the test per-client is largely up to the implementor. Similarly,
whether the .json files are hand-written or generated by some other program
is up to the implementor.

Conformance test runners must be implemented per language, per client (for
clients that have conformance tests defined here). These runners must do the
minimal work to translate a conformance test specified here into a testcase
that inputs the given input data and asserts based on the given assertion.

Generally, conformance tests are accessed as [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
in the repositories. However, copy-pasting the tests may also be a reasonable
approach, though it is prone to scalability and maintainability issues.
